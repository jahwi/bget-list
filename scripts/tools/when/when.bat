:: DESCRIPTION
::
:: This script extends conditionals in Windows batch scenarios. Once 
:: included to your script it allows to construct the more powerful and 
:: flexible conditionals implemented on "steroids".
::
:: This script declares two "functions" implementing conditional operators 
:: for performing additional conditional expressions over files and 
:: strings. These functions exit with a status of (0) or (1) depending on 
:: the evaluations of an expression.
::
:: Expression could be in the standard form for the "IF" operator used in 
:: batch scenarios. For the details of the syntax read the help page by 
:: the "IF /?" command. 
::
:: The second form came from the Bash's "test" builtin command that 
:: extends capabilities of the standard operator in batches. In other 
:: words, there are steroids. 
::
::
:: USAGE
::
:: 1.  Run the following command to see this page
::
::     when HELP
::
:: 2.  Execute the following command to embed the functionality into  your 
::     script "filename"
::
::     when APPEND-TO filename
::
::     After that you can get these features as below:
::
::     call :if -f "%COMSPEC%" && echo FILE
::
:: 3.  These functions would be available on the whole system wherever you 
::     were. Put this script to some place on your system declared in the 
::     %PATH% variable and call the functions as it is shown below:
::
::     call when :if -f "%COMSPEC%" && echo FILE
::
@echo off &rem ::
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion & set "param=%~1" & if /i "!param!" == "HELP" ( for /f "tokens=* delims=:" %%a in ( 'findstr /b "::" "%~f0"' ) do (set "s=%%a" & if defined s (echo:!s:~1!) else (echo:)) ) & endlocal & exit /b 0
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion & set "param=%~1" & if /i "!param!" == "APPEND-TO" ( set "filename=%~2" & if "!filename!" == "" ( findstr /v "::" "%~f0" ) else ( findstr /v "::" "%~f0" >>"!filename!" ) ) & endlocal & exit /b 0
call %* &rem ::
goto :EOF &rem ::


::
:: if EXPR
:: unless EXPR
::
:: Evaluates conditional expressions and returns the status of (0) if the 
:: expression is true, otherwise (1). Returns the status of (2) if an 
:: invalid argumnts are given.
::

::
:: "UNLESS" works similar to "IF" but the sense of the test is reversed.
::
:unless
call :if %* && exit /b 1
if %ERRORLEVEL% == 2 exit /b 2
exit /b 0


::
:: To perform extended conditional operators this solution considers some 
:: arguments (starting with the "-" symbol) as special operators. To avoid 
:: confusion between those operators and normal arguments it's recommended 
:: wrap the comparable arguments within double quotes. Operators must be 
:: left unquoted anyway. So the following examples will work properly:
::
::     copy nul equ
::     call :if  -e  "equ"      && echo FILE EXISTS
::     call :if "-e"  equ  "-e" && echo EQUAL STRINGS
::
:if
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion


::
:: Extended file operators:
::
set if_opt1=%1

:: -a FILE
::     True if file exists.
:: -b FILE
::     True if file is drive.
:: -c FILE
::     True if file is character device.
:: -d FILE
::     True if file is a directory. Similar to "-attr d".
:: -e FILE
::     True if file exists.
:: -f FILE
::     True if file exists and is a regular file.
:: -h FILE
::     True if file is a link. Similar to "-attr l".
:: -L FILE
::     True if file is a link. Similar to "-attr l".
:: -r FILE
::     True if file is read only. Similar to "-attr r".
:: -s FILE
::     True if file exists and is not empty.
:: -w FILE
::     True if the file is writable, i.e. not read only.
:: -x FILE
::     True if the file is executable.

::
:: Standard operators
::
:: IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number
:: IF [NOT] string1==string2
:: IF [NOT] EXIST filename
::
:: IF CMDEXTVERSION number
:: IF [NOT] DEFINED variable
:: IF [/I] string1 compare-op string2
::
:: NOT
::     Specifies that Windows should carry out the command only if the 
::     condition is false.
::
:: ERRORLEVEL number
::     Specifies a true condition if the last program run returned an exit 
::     code equal to or greater than the number specified.
::
:: string1==string2
::     Specifies a true condition if the specified text strings match. 
::
:: EXIST filename
::     Specifies a true condition if the specified filename exists.
::
:: CMDEXTVERSION number
::     The CMDEXTVERSION conditional works just like ERRORLEVEL, except it 
::     iscomparing against an internal version number associated with the 
::     Command Extensions.
::
:: DEFINED variable
::     The DEFINED conditional works just like EXIST except it takes an 
::     environment variable name and returns true if the environment 
::     variable is defined.
::
:: compare-op
::
:: EQU
::     Equal
:: NEQ
::     Not equal
:: LSS
::     Less than
:: LEQ
::     Less than or equal
:: GTR
::     Greater than
:: GEQ
::     Greater than or equal
::
:: /I
::     If specified, says to do case insensitive string compares. The /I 
::     switch can also be used on the string1==string2 form of IF. These 
::     comparisons are generic, in that if both string1 and string2 are 
::     both comprised of all numeric digits, then the strings are 
::     converted to numbers and a numeric comparison is performed.

::
:: LIMITATIONS
::
:: Even though the steroids cover and unify many uncertain features of 
:: batch files they have few limitations coming from the batches 
:: themselves. 
::
:: We can never be sure that arguments of scripts are completely checked. 
:: Anytime a user can pass a string to an argument that will be executed 
:: as never expected. 
::
:: Sometimes we can lost some input characters in the arguments. For 
:: example, it is true for "!" under the "enabledelayedexpansion" mode.
